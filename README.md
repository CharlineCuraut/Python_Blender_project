# Project in Blender using Python

## Description

This project is for a M1 course in Computer Sciences. Its original goal was to model a 2D drawn story into 3D using Python for Blender. Although I never used Blender before that project so it's mostly discovering Python for Blender. The 2D story chosen is called ["Hold close"](images_comic_book) and was written by Ingrid Tan. Actually, I had only two months to do it so I could only model one character. But I used Python to shape a character's body, create some materials (especially for the eyes), create a modifier (to simulate the fire shape), create its armature and do some animations (one for the fire movement and one to animate the character to wave at camera).

## Howto

The file flame_boy.py is the code used to create the character. But there is one thing I couldn't code: it is the materials of the characters (especially the fire material). I did it using the buttons so it should be on the file flame_boy.blend. 

You can just open the flame_boy.blend file with Blender. 

Or you can open Blender and run the flame_boy.py file in the "scripting" part.

You can see the final result of my work [here](project_rendering.mp4). More informations about the project can be found in the [report](IG3D_REPORT) I did for my teachers.
